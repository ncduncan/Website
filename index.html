                        <h3>West Neck Holdings was founded by Nat Duncan to acquire a family-owned small business in New England.</h3>
                        <p>Born and raised in Connecticut, my family has lived in New England and run family businesses for multiple generations. I am programmed with the work ethic and values that make our region great.</p>
                        <p>My career at General Electric has spanned executive leadership roles in 20 cities across 4 continents before I returned to Boston where my wife Caitlin is a pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital.  We are committed to building our family here.</p>
                        <p>Outside work, I enjoy staying active by hiking, skiing, and sailing. We also enjoy traveling across New England to experience the region's history and culture. These connections shape my approach to business ownership and community impact.</p>
