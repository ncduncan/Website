                        <p><strong>West Neck Holdings was founded by Nat Duncan to acquire a family-owned small business in New England. <em>We are the anti-private equity shop.</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Born and raised in Connecticut, my family has lived in New England and run family businesses for multiple generations. I have a deep appreciation for the work ethic and values that drive New England's business community.</p>
                        <p>My career at General Electric spanned 20 cities across 4 continents before I returned to Boston where my wife Caitlin is a pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital.  We are committed to building our family here.</p>
                        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy staying active by hiking, skiing, and sailing. I also enjoy traveling across New England with my wife, studying the deep history and culture. This connection to the region shapes my approach to business ownership and community impact.</p>
